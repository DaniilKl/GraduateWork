# GraduateWork
Here is my repository for the graduate work I am writing in Gdansk University of
technology.

This repository consists of several folders, exactly:
- Docs - contains all docs I write by myself;
- Code - contains code;
- Resources - contains documentation, links to sites, books and etc.. That is,
all source of knowledge I am using to complete this work.

This repository is under MIT license, that is free to use, share and etc.. But
be careful, I do not guarantee anything.
