Since 2016, WikiArt features female artists' pages. According to the statement on the site, it "... advocates for better representation of women artists. It addresses the gender imbalance in the presentation of art by bringing to light important women artists of the past and promoting great women artists working today. It is designed to bring recognition to the achievements of women artists of all periods and nationalities, distinguishing them within the male-dominated art world."
